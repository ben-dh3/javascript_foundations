// Callbacks are used a lot in JavaScript, so it's important to understand how they work. You'll see later how they can be useful.

// A callback is a function:

const printMessage = () => {
  console.log('Hello there');
}
// But we don't use the name "callback" for any function. Usually, we can say a function is used as "callback" when it's given to another function, to be called later.
